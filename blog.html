        <h1>What is Terrace Farming ?</h1>
        <p>
          This type of farming is done on the roof of the house. It can be also
          called as a roof garden. It is a garden in which vegetables and fruits
          are grown on terraces, balconies or roofs of buildings. The primary
          advantage of terraces is improved soil erosion control. It doesn’t
          matter how big or small your rooftop is, with the right planning and
          little efforts you can transform your terrace into a farm.
